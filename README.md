# **Red-tailed-Hawk-Analyses**

## Project Background
This Respository is set up to contain the code for all of my dissertation chapters that are focused on various aspects of the migratory ecology of Red-tailed Hawks *Buteo jamaicensis* that migrate through the Straits of Mackinac in Michigan.
Each chapter has its own folder where the code used to clean/prep the data and run each analysis will be provided. The actual movement data will not be stored here but can be made available upon reasonable request.


### Chapter 1
The code in this particular folder was used to run the analysis for the manuscript by _Alioto et al. 2025_ titled: **Crossing the Strait: Wind and uplift facilitate water crossing behavior for a soaring migrant in spring**. This manuscript is in prep and is being submitted to *movement ecology*. The code in this folder cleans both the weather and behavioural data and then a separate script merges the two together. Finally a script to run the GLMMs (_Generalized Linear Mixed Models_) and create the correpsonding conditional effects plots seen in the manuscript are provided.
